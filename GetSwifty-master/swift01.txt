Arrays - they're whack
here's some codee for swift to use later, maybe in repl.it


import Cocoa

var str = "Hello, Sally"
print(str)

var names:[String] = ["Gibby","Briar","Hrothgar","thingOne","Thing2","Randy","Hogan","rick"]

for name in (names){
    print("Hello", name)
}


for i in 2...4 {       //this is inclucsive
    print(names[i])
}

for n in names{
    print(n, "is present")
}
print("gang's all here")
*/

var sum = 0
var max = -1

var ages:[Int] = [13,26,19,22,35]
for a in ages{
sum = sum + a

if (a > max) {
        max = a
    }

}
print("The sum of the ages is",sum,"that's pretty old!")
print("The maximum age is",max,"years old.")

var nums:[Int] = []
var c = 1
while c < 101 {
    nums.append(c)
    c = c + 1
}
for n in nums{
    print(n)
}
print("agian!")


//this next thing is not inclusive . be sure to make sure you don't get those pesky off by one errors
//ALWAYS quintuple check your loops
//they pay us to be right EVERY time
//break your own code


for d in stride(from: 20, to: 1, by: -2){
    print(d)
}

var electroDice: Int
var odds = 0
var evens = 0

for i in 0..<1000(
    electroDice = Int(arc4random_uniform(6)) + 1;

    if electroDice == 1 || electroDice == 3 || electroDice == 5{


}
